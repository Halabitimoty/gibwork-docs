# Bug Reporting and Tipping Guidelines

Welcome to the Gibwork repository! We appreciate your interest in reporting bugs and helping us improve our project. To encourage and express our gratitude for your contributions, we have introduced a tipping system for bug reporters.

## Reporting a Bug

When reporting a bug, please follow these steps:

1. Check Existing Issues:

   - Before opening a new issue, check if the bug has already been reported. If so, add any additional information or details that might help in resolving the issue.

2. Provide Detailed Information:

   - Clearly describe the bug, including steps to reproduce it. Attach screenshots or code snippets if applicable. The more information you provide, the easier it is for us to understand and fix the issue.

3. Label the Issue:

   - Assign relevant labels to the issue, such as "bug" or other categorizations that apply. This helps us prioritize and address issues efficiently.

4. Tipping System:

   - To show our appreciation for your effort in reporting a bug, we have a tipping system in place. If you'd like to participate, check our Tipping Guidelines for details on how to receive a tip for your contribution.

## Tipping Guidelines

We believe in recognizing and rewarding the efforts of our community members. If you report a bug that is acknowledged and fixed by our team, you may be eligible to receive a tip as a token of our gratitude.

Please refer to the Tipping Guidelines for more information on how to participate in the tipping system.

## Code of Conduct

We have a Code of Conduct in place to ensure a positive and inclusive community environment. By reporting bugs or participating in the tipping system, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct.

## Thank You!

Thank you for contributing to Gibwork. Your bug reports and participation in the tipping system make a significant impact on the project's improvement. We look forward to your continued involvement!

#### Happy Coding! ðŸš€
